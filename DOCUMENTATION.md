## Component Documentation

### App Component

The main component that sets up routing and renders the main layout. Located in `src/App.js`.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <main className='overflow-x-hidden'>
        <UpdateFollower 
          mouseOptions={{
            backgroundColor: "White", 
            zIndex: 999,
            followSpeed: 1.7,
          }}>
          <Navbar />
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={
              <>
                <Hero />
                <Services/>
                <Banner />

            <Route path="/reviews" element={<Reviews />} />
            <Route path="/checkout" element={<CheckoutForm />} />
          </Routes>
        </UpdateFollower>
        <Footern />
      </main>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

## State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management with hooks:

- **useState**: For component-level state management
- **useEffect**: For side effects and lifecycle events
- **Props**: For parent-child component communication

Example from the Hero component:

```jsx
const [activeData, setActiveData] = React.useState(HeadphoneData[0]);

const handleActiveData = (data) => {
  setActiveData(data);
};
```

## Styling System

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling with custom configuration in `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: "#094f47",
        brandDark: "#050e2e",
      },
      fontFamily: {
        poppins: ["poppins", "sans-serief"],
        gotham: ["gotham", "sans-serief"],
      },
      container: {
        center: true,
        padding:{
          default: "1rem",
          sm:"2rem",
          lg:"4rem",
          xl:"5rem",
          "2xl":"6rem",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Key styling features:
- Custom color palette
- Custom font families
- Responsive container settings
- Utility classes for spacing, colors, and typography

## Animation System

Animations are implemented using Framer Motion with custom animation variants:

```jsx
const fadeUp = (delay) => {
  return {
    hidden: {
      opacity: 0,
      y: 100,
      scale: 0.5,
    },
    show: {
      opacity: 1,
      y: 0,
      scale: 1,
      transition: {
        duration: 0.8,
        delay: delay,
        ease: easeInOut,
      },
    },
    exit: {
      opacity: 0,
      y: 50,
      scale: 0.5,
      transition: {
        duration: 0.8,
        ease: easeInOut,
      },
    },
  };
};
```

The `UpdateFollower` component from React Mouse Follower is used to create custom cursor effects:

```jsx
<UpdateFollower mouseOptions={{
  backgroundColor: item.bgColor,
  zIndex: 999,
  followSpeed: 0.7,       
  scale: 5,
  text: "View Details",
  textFontSize: "3px",
  rotate: -360,
}}>
  {/* Component content */}
</UpdateFollower>
```

## Routing

Routing is implemented using React Router v7 with the following routes:

- `/`: Home page
- `/about`: About page
- `/contact`: Contact page
- `/reviews`: Reviews page
- `/checkout`: Checkout page

## Best Practices

### Code Organization

- Group related components in dedicated folders
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks or utility functions

### Performance Optimization

- Use `React.memo` for expensive components that don't need frequent re-renders
- Implement lazy loading for images and components
- Use proper dependency arrays in useEffect hooks
- Keep component state as local as possible

### Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure proper color contrast
- Support keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future development:

1. **Authentication System**: Add user accounts and authentication
2. **Cart Functionality**: Implement a shopping cart for multiple items
3. **Product Database**: Move product data to a backend database
4. **Payment Integration**: Add real payment processing
5. **Internationalization**: Add support for multiple languages
6. **Dark Mode**: Implement a theme toggle for light/dark mode
7. **Progressive Web App**: Convert to a PWA for offline access
